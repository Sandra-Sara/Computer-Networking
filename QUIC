This slide explains QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections), which is an application-layer protocol developed to improve the performance of HTTP traffic.
Key Points
QUIC operates on top of UDP, instead of the traditional TCP.
Its main objective is to increase the performance of HTTP, making connections faster and more efficient.
QUIC is widely used on many Google servers and applications, such as Chrome and the mobile YouTube app.
Stack Diagram Explanation
The stack diagram shows the traditional HTTP/2 over TCP/IP architecture:
Application Layer: HTTP/2
Security Layer: TLS (Transport Layer Security)
Transport Layer: TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
Network Layer: IP (Internet Protocol)
In traditional architecture, HTTP/2 relies on TCP and TLS for transport and security, respectively. QUIC replaces TCP with a UDP-based solution, integrating both 
transport and security (like TLS) in a single protocol, reducing latency and improving connection efficiency.


No, the stack diagram shown in the image is not for QUIC; it depicts the traditional HTTP/2 over TCP/IP stack, which includes HTTP/2, TLS, TCP, and IP layers. 
QUIC replaces the TCP layer with UDP and combines transport and security features into a single protocol, typically supporting HTTP/3 rather than HTTP/2. 
In a typical QUIC stack, you would see HTTP/3, QUIC, UDP, and IP as the layers instead of HTTP/2/TLS/TCP/IP.
