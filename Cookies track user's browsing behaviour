🔹 Image 1: First-party vs. Third-party Cookies
User visits nytimes.com (sports)
Browser sends an HTTP GET request.
Server replies with content + sets a cookie (1634) → this is a first-party cookie, because it comes from the website you chose to visit.
The page also loads ads from AdX.com (an ad network).
The browser makes another HTTP GET request to AdX.com, with “Referrer: NY Times Sports”.
AdX.com responds and sets its own cookie (7493).
This is a third-party cookie, because it comes from a site you did not directly visit.
 At this point:
Browser has two cookies:
1634 (from nytimes.com – first party)
7493 (from adx.com – third party)


🔹 Image 2: Cross-Site Tracking
Now the user visits a different site: socks.com.
Browser requests page → socks.com responds.
socks.com also loads ads from AdX.com.
Browser makes request to AdX.com, this time including cookie 7493 (the one it got earlier).
AdX now knows:
This same user visited nytimes.com (sports) earlier.
Now they are on socks.com.
 AdX can track browsing behavior across multiple sites (nytimes.com, socks.com, etc.), because its third-party cookie is present on all of them.


🔹 Image 3: Targeted Ads (One Day Later)
Next day, the user visits nytimes.com (arts section).
Browser sends cookie 1634 (nytimes.com first-party).
Also sends cookie 7493 (adx.com third-party) when ads are loaded.
AdX sees cookie 7493 → recognizes this user from yesterday.
It knows:
They visited NYT Sports (2/15)
They visited Socks.com (2/16)
Now they’re on NYT Arts (2/17).
AdX sends back a targeted ad for socks!
Because it “remembers” the user’s browsing history.
