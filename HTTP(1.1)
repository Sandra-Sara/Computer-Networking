ðŸ”¹ HTTP/1.1
Improvement over HTTP/1.0:
Instead of opening a new TCP connection for every object (very costly), HTTP/1.1 introduced:
Persistent connections (reuse the same TCP connection).
Pipelining (send multiple GET requests without waiting for responses).
Problem: FCFS (First-Come-First-Served) response order
Server must send responses in the same order as requests arrived.
Suppose the first request is for a large image and the second is for a small CSS file.
The CSS file must wait until the image is done before being sent â†’ this is Head-of-Line (HOL) blocking.
Problem: TCP loss recovery
If a TCP segment (a piece of data) is lost, TCP must retransmit.
Until retransmission succeeds, all pending objects are stalled.
This amplifies the HOL blocking problem.
