This image explains how email mail servers work by outlining the role of mail servers, the SMTP protocol, and the flow of messages between clients and servers.
Mail Servers
A mail server manages email for users by handling two main storage areas: the mailbox (which contains incoming emails for a user) and the message queue 
(which stores outgoing emails that still need to be sent).
SMTP Protocol
The Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is used to send emails between mail servers.
The sending mail server acts as the client, while the receiving mail server is considered the "server" during this transaction.
Flow of Messages
When a user sends an email using a user agent (like an email app), the message is placed in the outgoing message queue of the user's mail server (shown in green).
Using SMTP, the mail server transmits the email to the recipient's mail server, where it is stored in the recipientâ€™s mailbox (shown in yellow).
Users access their mailbox via their user agent to read incoming messages.
