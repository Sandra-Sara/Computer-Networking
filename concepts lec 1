1.What is Internet?
  Ans:The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other using a common set of rules called protocols (mainly TCP/IP).

🌍 Global network: It connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks worldwide.
📡 Communication: Devices exchange data through wired (fiber, cables) and wireless (Wi-Fi, cellular, satellite) technologies.
📧 Services: It supports services such as the World Wide Web (WWW), email, file transfer, online gaming, streaming, social media, and cloud computing.
🔗 Decentralized: No single person or organization owns the entire Internet—it’s maintained by collaboration between service providers, organizations, and protocols.

  2.Service View Of Internet
provides programming interface to distributed applications:
“hooks” allowing sending/receiving  apps to “connect” to, use  Internet transport service
provides service options, analogous to postal service
3.What is Protocol?
Protocols define the format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission, receipt .

 4.Network edge: hosts, access network, physical media
1.hosts: clients and servers
servers often in data centers

2.Access networks, physical media:
wired, wireless communication links 

5.Network core: 
interconnected routers
network of networks

14 page diagram explanation
This image explains cable-based access networks, which are commonly used to provide internet services to homes through cable TV infrastructure.
Let’s break it down:
1. Cable-based access setup
Homes are connected via coaxial cable to a cable headend (the service provider’s central hub).
Each home has a cable modem that connects computers and TVs.
A splitter separates internet (data) signals and television signals.
2. Shared cable
All the homes in a neighborhood share the same coaxial cable line back to the cable headend.
This means bandwidth is shared among users.
3. Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
The coaxial cable carries multiple signals at the same time by assigning each service to a different frequency band.
For example:
Some frequencies carry video channels (TV programs).
Other frequencies carry data channels (Internet traffic, upload/download).
A separate frequency band is used for control signals.
The diagram at the bottom shows how different channels (1–9) are placed into separate frequency bands:
Channels 1–6 → Video
Channel 7–8 → Data (Internet)
Channel 9 → Control
4. Key Point
The main concept here is Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), which allows multiple signals (TV, internet, control) to travel simultaneously
over the same cable by using different frequency ranges.
👉 In short:
This image shows how cable internet works: multiple households connect through coaxial cable to the headend, and signals for TV, internet,
and control are separated using FDM so that they can coexist without interference.
