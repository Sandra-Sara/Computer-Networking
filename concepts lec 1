1.What is Internet?
Ans:The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other using a common 
set of rules called protocols (mainly TCP/IP).

üåç Global network: It connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks worldwide.
üì° Communication: Devices exchange data through wired (fiber, cables) and wireless (Wi-Fi, cellular, satellite) technologies.
üìß Services: It supports services such as the World Wide Web (WWW), email, file transfer, online gaming, streaming, social media,
and cloud computing.
üîó Decentralized: No single person or organization owns the entire Internet‚Äîit‚Äôs maintained by collaboration between service providers, 
organizations, and protocols.

  2.Service View Of Internet
provides programming interface to distributed applications:
‚Äúhooks‚Äù allowing sending/receiving  apps to ‚Äúconnect‚Äù to, use  Internet transport service
provides service options, analogous to postal service
3.What is Protocol?
Protocols define the format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission, receipt .

Packet Switches
A packet switch is a device in a computer network that receives, stores, and forwards packets (small chunks of data).
Instead of sending a whole message at once, data is broken into packets, and each packet can take its own path across the network.

 4.Network edge: hosts, access network, physical media
1.hosts: clients and servers
servers often in data centers

2.Access networks, physical media:
wired, wireless communication links 

5.Network core: 
interconnected routers
network of networks

14 page diagram explanation
This image explains cable-based access networks, which are commonly used to provide internet services to homes through cable TV infrastructure.
Let‚Äôs break it down:
1. Cable-based access setup
Homes are connected via coaxial cable to a cable headend (the service provider‚Äôs central hub).
Each home has a cable modem that connects computers and TVs.
A splitter separates internet (data) signals and television signals.
2. Shared cable
All the homes in a neighborhood share the same coaxial cable line back to the cable headend.
This means bandwidth is shared among users.
3. Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
The coaxial cable carries multiple signals at the same time by assigning each service to a different frequency band.
For example:
Some frequencies carry video channels (TV programs).
Other frequencies carry data channels (Internet traffic, upload/download).
A separate frequency band is used for control signals.
The diagram at the bottom shows how different channels (1‚Äì9) are placed into separate frequency bands:
Channels 1‚Äì6 ‚Üí Video
Channel 7‚Äì8 ‚Üí Data (Internet)
Channel 9 ‚Üí Control
4. Key Point
The main concept here is Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), which allows multiple signals (TV, internet, control) to travel simultaneously
over the same cable by using different frequency ranges.
 In short:
This image shows how cable internet works: multiple households connect through coaxial cable to the headend, and signals for TV, internet,
and control are separated using FDM so that they can coexist without interference.

7.What is ISP router?
An ISP router is the router used by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to connect you (the customer) to the wider internet. 
Let‚Äôs break it down:
1. Where it sits
Your devices (PC, phone, smart TV, etc.) connect to your home router/modem.
That modem/router connects to your ISP‚Äôs network equipment.
One key piece of that equipment is the ISP router ‚Äî a high-capacity router at the ISP‚Äôs side.


8.Slide 16 image explanation
This image explains DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) access networks, which provide Internet access using existing telephone lines.
Let‚Äôs break it down step by step:
1. Home setup
In each house, a DSL modem is connected to the telephone line.
A splitter is used to separate:
Voice signals (for regular phone calls).
Data signals (for Internet).
Both travel on the same copper telephone line but at different frequency ranges:
Lower frequencies ‚Üí voice.
Higher frequencies ‚Üí Internet data.
2. Transmission to the central office
Each home has a dedicated line running to the ISP‚Äôs central office.
At the central office, a device called DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer) collects all DSL connections from many homes.
The DSLAM separates:
Voice traffic ‚Üí goes into the traditional telephone network.
Data traffic ‚Üí goes to the ISP‚Äôs Internet routers.
3. Data flow
Internet data from your computer ‚Üí DSL modem ‚Üí telephone line ‚Üí DSLAM ‚Üí ISP routers ‚Üí Internet.
Voice calls from your phone ‚Üí telephone line ‚Üí DSLAM ‚Üí telephone network.
4. Performance
DSL provides dedicated bandwidth to each home (unlike cable, where neighbors share bandwidth).
Speeds (depending on DSL type and distance from the central office):
Downstream (download): 24‚Äì52 Mbps
Upstream (upload): 3.5‚Äì16 Mbps
Summary:
This diagram shows how DSL uses the existing telephone line to carry both voice and Internet data simultaneously.
The splitter in the home and the DSLAM in the central office make sure that data goes to the Internet and voice goes to the telephone network,
without interfering with each other.

9.What is end system?
In networking, an end system (also called a host) refers to any device at the "edge" of the network that uses the network to send or 
receive data.End system = the user‚Äôs device (like a PC or phone) that connects to the router through the shared wireless network.

10.What is Wireless Access Network?
A wireless access network (WAN) is a type of network that allows devices to connect to the Internet or a local network without 
using physical cables. Instead, it uses wireless communication technologies, like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks.

11.27 number slide explanation
This slide explains the two key functions of the network core (inside routers): Forwarding and Routing.

1. Forwarding (Local Action)
Also called switching.
It happens inside a single router.
Task: Move a packet from the router‚Äôs input link to the correct output link.
Uses a forwarding table:
The router checks the destination address in the packet header.
Looks up the corresponding output port (e.g., 0111 ‚Üí output link 2).
Sends the packet out through that port.
Key idea: It is a local decision, done per packet, inside each router.

2. Routing (Global Action)
Happens across the whole network.
Task: Determine the end-to-end path packets should take from source to destination.
Uses routing algorithms (e.g., Dijkstra‚Äôs shortest path, distance vector, OSPF, BGP).
Once paths are computed, each router‚Äôs forwarding table is updated accordingly.
Key idea: It is a global decision, considering all routers and links.


11.Data Center Network
high-bandwidth links (10s to 100s Gbps) connect hundreds to thousands of servers together, and to Internet


11.32 number page explanation(Packet Switching & Queueing)
Packet-Switching and Queueing
Packet-switching is a method used in computer networks where data is broken into packets and each packet is sent independently
to the destination. In this diagram, computers A and B send packets via a router to other networks. Each packet travels through
a network where every link has a maximum transmission rate (speed), such as 100 Mb/s close to the source and 1.5 Mb/s on the next segment.

Queueing and Loss Explained
When the arrival rate (in bits-per-second) of packets to a router exceeds the outgoing link's capacity (for example,
if packets arrive faster than 1.5 Mb/s), a queue forms in the router‚Äôs memory (buffer).
If the buffer isn't full, incoming packets are queued and wait for their turn to be sent.
If the buffer fills up (due to heavy or sustained excess traffic), any new arriving packets are dropped‚Äîthis is called "packet loss."
Key Points
Packets wait in a queue if a router's output link is busy.
Excess packets are lost if the queue (buffer) becomes full, reducing overall transmission reliability.
This mechanism underpins why delays or data loss can occur in networks with heavy usage.


12.Alternative to packet switching: circuit switching

13.Page 33 explanation (Circuit Switching)
What is circuit switching?
In circuit switching, end-to-end resources are allocated and reserved for a call between a source and a destination.
This is like how traditional telephone networks work: when you call someone, a dedicated path is reserved for the duration of your call.
2. Diagram explanation
The diagram shows four routers (or switches) connected by links, each link having four circuits.
A call between two computers (shown in red) gets a dedicated circuit in each link along its path:
Example: 2nd circuit in the top link, 1st circuit in the right link.
Red line represents the allocated path for this specific call.
3. Characteristics of circuit switching
Dedicated resources: Each circuit is reserved for the call; no sharing with other calls.
Circuit-like performance: Guaranteed bandwidth and predictable performance because the path is exclusive.
Idle circuits: If the call is not using the circuit at some moment, that segment is idle (wasted resources).
Common usage: Used in traditional telephone networks where guaranteed connections are required.
