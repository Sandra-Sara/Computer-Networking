1.What is Internet?
Ans:The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and devices that communicate with each other using a common 
set of rules called protocols (mainly TCP/IP).

üåç Global network: It connects millions of private, public, academic, business, and government networks worldwide.
üì° Communication: Devices exchange data through wired (fiber, cables) and wireless (Wi-Fi, cellular, satellite) technologies.
üìß Services: It supports services such as the World Wide Web (WWW), email, file transfer, online gaming, streaming, social media,
and cloud computing.
üîó Decentralized: No single person or organization owns the entire Internet‚Äîit‚Äôs maintained by collaboration between service providers, 
organizations, and protocols.

  2.Service View Of Internet
provides programming interface to distributed applications:
‚Äúhooks‚Äù allowing sending/receiving  apps to ‚Äúconnect‚Äù to, use  Internet transport service
provides service options, analogous to postal service
3.What is Protocol?
Protocols define the format, order of messages sent and received among network entities, and actions taken on message transmission, receipt .

 4.Network edge: hosts, access network, physical media
1.hosts: clients and servers
servers often in data centers

2.Access networks, physical media:
wired, wireless communication links 

5.Network core: 
interconnected routers
network of networks

14 page diagram explanation
This image explains cable-based access networks, which are commonly used to provide internet services to homes through cable TV infrastructure.
Let‚Äôs break it down:
1. Cable-based access setup
Homes are connected via coaxial cable to a cable headend (the service provider‚Äôs central hub).
Each home has a cable modem that connects computers and TVs.
A splitter separates internet (data) signals and television signals.
2. Shared cable
All the homes in a neighborhood share the same coaxial cable line back to the cable headend.
This means bandwidth is shared among users.
3. Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
The coaxial cable carries multiple signals at the same time by assigning each service to a different frequency band.
For example:
Some frequencies carry video channels (TV programs).
Other frequencies carry data channels (Internet traffic, upload/download).
A separate frequency band is used for control signals.
The diagram at the bottom shows how different channels (1‚Äì9) are placed into separate frequency bands:
Channels 1‚Äì6 ‚Üí Video
Channel 7‚Äì8 ‚Üí Data (Internet)
Channel 9 ‚Üí Control
4. Key Point
The main concept here is Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM), which allows multiple signals (TV, internet, control) to travel simultaneously
over the same cable by using different frequency ranges.
 In short:
This image shows how cable internet works: multiple households connect through coaxial cable to the headend, and signals for TV, internet,
and control are separated using FDM so that they can coexist without interference.

7.What is ISP router?
An ISP router is the router used by your Internet Service Provider (ISP) to connect you (the customer) to the wider internet. 
Let‚Äôs break it down:
1. Where it sits
Your devices (PC, phone, smart TV, etc.) connect to your home router/modem.
That modem/router connects to your ISP‚Äôs network equipment.
One key piece of that equipment is the ISP router ‚Äî a high-capacity router at the ISP‚Äôs side.


8.Slide 16 image explanation
This image explains DSL (Digital Subscriber Line) access networks, which provide Internet access using existing telephone lines.
Let‚Äôs break it down step by step:
1. Home setup
In each house, a DSL modem is connected to the telephone line.
A splitter is used to separate:
Voice signals (for regular phone calls).
Data signals (for Internet).
Both travel on the same copper telephone line but at different frequency ranges:
Lower frequencies ‚Üí voice.
Higher frequencies ‚Üí Internet data.
2. Transmission to the central office
Each home has a dedicated line running to the ISP‚Äôs central office.
At the central office, a device called DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer) collects all DSL connections from many homes.
The DSLAM separates:
Voice traffic ‚Üí goes into the traditional telephone network.
Data traffic ‚Üí goes to the ISP‚Äôs Internet routers.
3. Data flow
Internet data from your computer ‚Üí DSL modem ‚Üí telephone line ‚Üí DSLAM ‚Üí ISP routers ‚Üí Internet.
Voice calls from your phone ‚Üí telephone line ‚Üí DSLAM ‚Üí telephone network.
4. Performance
DSL provides dedicated bandwidth to each home (unlike cable, where neighbors share bandwidth).
Speeds (depending on DSL type and distance from the central office):
Downstream (download): 24‚Äì52 Mbps
Upstream (upload): 3.5‚Äì16 Mbps
Summary:
This diagram shows how DSL uses the existing telephone line to carry both voice and Internet data simultaneously.
The splitter in the home and the DSLAM in the central office make sure that data goes to the Internet and voice goes to the telephone network,
without interfering with each other.

9.What is end system?
In networking, an end system (also called a host) refers to any device at the "edge" of the network that uses the network to send or 
receive data.End system = the user‚Äôs device (like a PC or phone) that connects to the router through the shared wireless network.

10.What is Wireless Access Network?
A wireless access network (WAN) is a type of network that allows devices to connect to the Internet or a local network without 
using physical cables. Instead, it uses wireless communication technologies, like Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, or cellular networks.
