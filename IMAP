Mail Access Protocols (for retrieving messages):
These are used by the recipient to access email stored on their mail server.
Two main ones are IMAP and POP3.
IMAP (Internet Mail Access Protocol, RFC 3501):
Email messages are kept on the server.
Client retrieves them when needed.
Supports message deletion, folders, and organization directly on the server.
Good for multi-device use (you see the same folders/messages everywhere).
POP3 (not mentioned but implied):
Downloads emails from the server to the client.
Often removes them from the server after download (unless configured otherwise).

HTTP (for Webmail like Gmail, Hotmail, Yahoo! Mail):
Provides a web-based interface for email.
Under the hood:
Uses SMTP to send email.
Uses IMAP or POP3 to retrieve messages.
